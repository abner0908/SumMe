Pinakakasuhan ng Ombudsman ng paglabag sa Section 3(e) ng Republic Act No. 3019 (Anti-Graft and Corrupt Practices Act) si dating mayor at kasalukuyang Vice-Mayor Allan Damas ng Kumalarang, Zamboanga Del Sur. May kinalaman ang kaso sa pag-appoint nito sa kanyang pinsan na si Nellie Toledo bilang municipal treasurer noong 2007. "That Damas gave unwarranted benefit, advantage or preference to Toledo as she was appointed in violation of Section 79 of the Local Government Code of 1991 which prohibits the appointment in the career service of any person who is related within the fourth civil degree of consanguinity or affinity to the appointing or recommending authority," nakasaad pa sa resolusyong ipinalabas ng Ombudsman.
