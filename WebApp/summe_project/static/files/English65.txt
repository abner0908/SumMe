Starting February 23, Filipinos can get visas to the United Kingdom within 24 hours through a super priority visa service, the British Embassy in the Philippines said.
In a statement Thursday, February 12, the British Embassy also said Filipino customers "including all visitors" can avail of a 3 to 5-day priority visa service.
The embassy said Filipino who avail of the 24-hour visa service will have to pay an additional £600 (P45,000) on top of regular charges.
Those who avail of the 3 to 5-day priority visa service need to pay an additional £100 (P7,500)
The standard visa service takes up to 15 working days.
In the embassy's statement Thursday, British Ambassador to the Philippines Asif Ahmad said the UK expects the 24-hour visa service "to be particularly useful for business where opportunities can arise at very short notice."

For 'last-minute holiday deals'

"We want entrepreneurs and businessmen to be able to seize these," Ahmad said.
He added, "The extension of our 3 to 5-day priority service to include all visitors without exception will also be welcome to those wanting to take advantage of any last-minute holiday deals."
In November, the British Embassy said the UK will also offer its 24-hour visa service in Turkey, South Africa, the United Arab Emirates, Thailand, and visa processing centers in New York and Paris.
Back then, the embassy said its 24-hour visa service in the Philippines will begin in April.
In its earlier statement, the embassy pointed out that visa applicants "must meet the strict requirements of our immigration rules." Going through the 24-hour service, it added, "does not in any way guarantee a visa application will be successful."
The service "is designed for business travelers but is available to those who want to pay a premium for expedited processing."
