Tulad ng Hollywood actress na si Renee Zelwegger, ginulat din ng aktres na si Uma Thurman ang mga tao sa premiere party ng kanyang mini-series na The Slap dahil hindi siya nakilala dahil may nabago sa mukha nito. Marami ang nagtaka kung bakit masyadong makinis ang noo at tila namamaga ang mga pisngi ng 44-year-old actress? Isama pa rito ang medyo maingat na pagngiti niya para sa mga kamera.Sey ni Uma na nag-iba lang daw siya ng make-up kaya hindi siya agad nakilala ng marami.Ayon sa isang Hollywood beauty expert at cosmetic doctor, may mga pinabago si Uma sa kanyang mukha at walang kinalaman ang make-up dito."Uma certainly looks like she's undergone a dramatic transformation and in my opinion, she's looking too overdone."The thing that strikes me most is that her eye area looks very different. It looks as though she's had a recent lower blepharoplasty treatment, also known as eye bag removal. She isn't wearing any eyeliner or mascara, probably in order to avoid infection from the new surgery."Her face shape seems to have changed significantly -- her face looks less defined. I would say that she's probably had a recent course of strong chemical peels as well as some dermal filler injected into the cheeks and nasal labial area; which is all contributing to this swollen-looking finish as it can have this effect immediately after undergoing these treatments."Her forehead is also very prominent and looks rather elongated, shiny, taut and line-free, which are all classic tell tale signs of regular Botox use."I would suggest that she's had too much pro-duct injected into this area, which is contribu-ting to her brow and upper eyelids looking very heavy."The combination of these possible procedures is making her look less youthful, and we'd advise Uma to lay off the treatments for a while and if and when she does have them, to remember that less is more."At her age, she would benefit from taking a more subtle approach as she is a naturally attractive woman and doesn't require too much product."
