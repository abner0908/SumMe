17 years after it became the Philippines' largest marine protected area, the Tañon Strait in the Visayas will finally have a conservation management plan.
From February 10 to 12, more than 400 local government officials, conservationists, scientists, fishermen, and resort owners are participating in the first summit that aims to harmonize local and national conservation policies to better protect the strait.
Most people don't know they've already been to Tañon Strait - whether for whaleshark-watching in Moalboal or for scuba diving with thresher sharks in Malapascua Island.
