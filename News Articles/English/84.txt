Alstom will build a geothermal power plant in Indonesia under a 61 million euro ($69 million) deal with a subsidiary of PT Pertamina, the French industrial giant said Wednesday, February 11.
The turnkey plant, to generate 30 megawatts, will be set up in Karaha, West Java.
Alstom will provide engineering, materials and construction in the project to be completed by the end of next year for PT Pertamina Geothermal Energy, Alstom said in a statement.
Indonesia, made up of thousands of islands stretching from the Indian to the Pacific Oceans, is home to some 130 volcanoes and is estimated to hold around 40% of the world's geothermal potential.
However it produces only a tiny fraction of its energy by converting underground heat into electricity, lagging far behind others such as the United States and the neighboring Philippines. (READ: New law to boost geothermal energy in Indonesia)
"We are delighted to play a key role in helping Indonesia achieve its energy goals," said Steven Moss, Alstom's vice president in charge of renewable steam plants.
"This installation reinforces Alstom’s continued commitment to the geothermal markets and the importance of this renewable fuel source,” he said.
News of the new project comes less than two months after Alstom plead guilty and paid a record $772.3 million penalty in a wide-ranging foreign bribery case that included bribing officials of Perusahaan Listrik Negara (PLN), Indonesia's state-ownedelectricity company, and a prominent Indonesian politician to win a lucrative contract to build coal power plans in Sumatra.
In April 2014, politician Izedrik Emir Moeis from the Indonesian Democratic Party of Struggle (PDI-P) was sentenced to 3 years in prison for accepting $357,000 in kickbacks from Alstom.
