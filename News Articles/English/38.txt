Canada's Prime Minister Stephen Harper reshuffled his cabinet Monday, February 9, to name new foreign and defense ministers.
Robert Nicholson, who has served as defense minister since 2013, was tapped to replace John Baird as foreign minister.
Nicholson will be replaced as defense chief by Jason Kenney, who will retain his post as minister for multiculturalism.
Pierre Poilievre will take over Kenney's other portfolio as minister of employment and social development.
Baird last week announced without explanation that he was stepping down, after a 20-year career in Canadian politics.
The changes come as Harper gears up for legislation election later this year.
