Political dynasties in the Sangguniang Kabataan (SK)? Not for long.
The National Youth Commission (NYC) lauds the passage of the SK Reform Bill on third reading in the Senate on Monday, February 9, calling it a “mechanism against political dynasties.”
“We are a big step closer to a meaningful SK,” said NYC Chairperson Gio Tingson. “The amendments in the approved version will democratize and professionalize the institution.”
Senate Bill 2401 proposes to establish “mechanisms for meaningful youth participation in nation building,” including the strengthening of the SK - an assembly of locally elected youth unique to the Philippines.
The bill, once passed into law, will bar political dynasties, expand the age requirement for SK officials from 15-17 to 18-27, allocate P74 M for a mandatory leadership and good governance training, and create local youth development councils.
The NYC supports the expansion of the “anti-dynasty” provision of the bill, calling it a landmark provision.
The Senate version of the bill bans any elected official's relatives, up to the second degree of consanguinity or affinity, from running for SK positions.
“The provision addresses the complaint that SK officials have been a breeding ground for traditional politicians,” Tingson added. “With both versions containing this anti-dynasty provision, it will surely be part of the bi-cameral once approved into law.”
NYC hopes that Congress will pass the bill by the end of the quarter.
On Thursday, February 5, the Commission on Elections (COMELEC) postpones the SK polls to April 2015. The current Senate bill will further postpone the polls to October 2016.
SK elections have been regularly postponed since 2013, due in part to public clamor for systemic reforms.
