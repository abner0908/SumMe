Three Filipino fighters will don the country's colors on the undercard of ONE FC: Age of Champions on March 13 at the 16,000-seater Stadium Putra in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia.
Cary Bullos squares off with Malaysian standout Ev Ting in a three-round featherweight tussle, while Ramon Gonzalez is scheduled to make his promotional debut against Cambodian combatant Chan Rothana.
Arguably the best mixed martial arts stalwart that was produced from Cebu, Bullos (7-2) has never won by way of scorecards, finishing seven of his last nine outings by either knockout or submission.
However, the 31-year-old Bullos suffered an excruciating defeat in the hands of Major Overall this past November as the American was able to submit him with a rear-naked choke in just 29 seconds.
Ting (8-2) had two successful ONE FC appearances last year, beating Yohan Mulia Legowo via first-round stoppage in June before knocking out Edward Kelly with a head kick four months later.
A tough test awaits Gonzalez as he locks horns with Rothana, who is a highly-touted Kun Khmer practitioner.
Gonzalez (1-0) has only one professional bout in his record that took place at Universal Reality Combat Championship's "Davao Digmaan" event in August 2009, while Rothana (2-1) recently turned his attention to prizefighting and had two matches under the ONE FC banner in 2014.
Also featured at ONE FC: Age of Champions is Pinay pugilist Jujeath Nagaowa (2-0), who meets Singaporean atomweight Kirstie Gannaway.
