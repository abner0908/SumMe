Pinterest users who've recently updated their Pinterest app on iPads or iPhones will see a new kind of Pin on their feeds: app Pins.
In an announcement post on the Pinterest blog on Wednesday, February 11, the company noted that the app Pins would allow users to download new applications straight from within the Pinterest app on iPads and iPhones.
Pinterest cited an example of someone wanting to download a new fitness app on their device. "Let’s say you’re Pinning workout inspiration to your Marathon Training board. If you see a fitness app that helps you reach your goals, you can download it right from Pinterest."
All that's needed is to tap Install, and the app will download right to the device.
The Pinterest App Store also has a profile for a collection of app Pins that can be checked out or saved from within the Pinterest App Store.
