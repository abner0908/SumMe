 Australia stepped up pressure on Indonesia Thursday, February 12, to spare the lives of two drug smugglers facing the firing squad, with Foreign Minister Julie Bishop warning their execution would be a grave injustice.
Andrew Chan and Myuran Sukumaran, the Australian ringleaders of the so-called "Bali Nine" heroin drug smuggling gang, were arrested in 2005 and sentenced to death the following year.
The pair recently lost their final appeals to Indonesian President Joko "Jokowi" Widodo for clemency despite arguing that they had rehabilitated themselves in prison. They could face the firing squad this month.
In an emotional speech in parliament, Bishop pleaded for their lives.
"This motion goes to the heart of what we believe will be a grave injustice against two Australian citizens facing execution in Indonesia," she said, adding that the pair made "shocking mistakes" but deserved another chance.
"We are not understating the gravity of the nature of these crimes.
"Without doubt, Andrew and Myuran need to pay for their crimes with lengthy jail sentences but they should not need to pay with their lives."
Indonesian authorities have already informed Canberra they intend to proceed with the executions, despite public appeals from Bishop and Prime Minister Tony Abbott.
Lawyers for the men on Wednesday lodged a rare legal challenge to the president's decision to reject their appeals for clemency, taking the unusual step of challenging Jokowi's decision to refuse them a pardon. 
Indonesian authorities have repeatedly said the appeal for presidential clemency is a death row convict's final chance to avoid the firing squad, but the men's lawyers believe the latest move could at least delay the executions.
"Our shared hope is the Indonesian government and its people will show mercy to Andrew and Myuran," said Bishop.
"Both men are deeply, sincerely remorseful for their actions. Both men have made extraordinary efforts to rehabilitate. Andrew and Myuran are the model of what penal systems the world over long to achieve."
Jokowi has been a vocal supporter of capital punishment and warned Indonesia is facing a drugs emergency, with addictions and deaths on the rise.
The men's lawyers claim it is "unacceptable" for the president to use blanket arguments to refuse clemency.
Indonesia last month executed 6 drug offenders, including 5 from other countries.
