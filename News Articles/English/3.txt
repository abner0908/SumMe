A rocket attack on Ukraine's military headquarters in the war-torn east killed at least 6 civilians Tuesday, February 10, officials said, as violence escalated ahead of a planned peace summit.
President Petro Poroshenko said that rockets from a Tornado multiple launch system hit the command centre in Kramatorsk, a town behind the frontlines which is considered to be under firm government control.
Local officials said the strikes killed at least 6 people and wounded 21 in nearby residential areas.
Ukrainian foreign ministry official Dmytro Kuleba tweeted that the rockets were Tornado, "Russia's newest Multiple Launch Rocket System. Ukraine simply doesn't have it."
Kiev accuses Moscow of supplying and training heavily armed separatists, but Russia denies this. Rebels say their weapons have been captured from Ukrainian forces, although Kiev has cited numerous cases of rebels deploying advanced weapons that are only available from Russian arsenals.
Kramatorsk was recaptured by government forces from rebels in June and made the regional capital of Ukrainian-controlled territory.
The rocket strike came as rebel forces pushed an offensive to take territory ahead of a planned peace summit in Minsk on Wednesday.
The closest rebel position to Kramatorsk is believed to be Gorlivka, around 45 kilometers (30 miles) to the southeast – well within the range of the Tornado rocket.
