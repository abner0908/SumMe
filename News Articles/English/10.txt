Next year, on this same day, the Philippines will be joining other countries that observes a National Safer Internet Day – that is, if bills proposing the February 10 celebration are enacted.
Senator Benigno Aquino IV and Quezon City 5th District Representative Alfredo Vargas III have filed bills declaring February 10 of each year as a day to remind the public of their responsibilities as Internet users. The bills were introduced at a press conference at the Midas Hotel in Pasay on Tuesday, February 10.
Senate Bill No. 2367 and House Bill 5429 "acknowledge both the challenges and opportunities brought forth by this technology that has been integrated in the lives of families, communities, and the country."
Speaking to reporters, Alwin de Leon, manager of Terre des Hommes Netherlands Philippine Country Office, said that of the more than 100 million people in the Philippines, 44 million people are Internet users and more than 28 million are mobile Internet users.
According to Senate Bill No. 2367, the government, through the Department of Transportation and Communications and the Department of Social Welfare and Development, would raise awareness of responsible and safe Internet use as well as avoiding practical pratfalls, such as hacking or child exploitation.
"Albeit useful, the Internet also has its perils. Because of its accessibility, many risks are also being confronted by the users – minors and adults alike," Vargas said in statement.
Aquino, in his own statement, added, "Everyone needs to be involved in making our connectedness online safe and secure."
