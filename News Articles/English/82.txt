Alex first earned Internet fame when customer and Twitter user @auscalum posted a photo of the cute Target employee innocently bagging groceries. A series of memes and photo manipulations followed afterwards. Alex also appeared on The Ellen DeGeneres Show as a guest.
However, Alex said that he’s been doing more things and shared 5 things he's exploring, though he didn't give more details: going on tour, releasing his own merchandise, being in a major music video, making his own music, and lastly, starring in a movie.
He also planned on making more videos for his online channel, with new ones coming out every Saturday.
